Book 1
Debts and Lessons

1.1 My Grandfather Verus
Character and self-control.

1.2 My Father (From My Own Memories and His Reputation)
Integrity and manliness.

1.3 My Mother
Her reverence for the divine, her generosity, her inability not only to do wrong but even to conceive of doing it. And the simple way she lived-not in the least like the rich

1.4  My Great-Grandfather
To avoid the public schools, to hire good private teachers, and to accept the resulting costs as money well-spent.

1.5 My First Teacher
Not to support this side or that in chariot-racing, this fighter or that in the games. To put up with discomfort and not make demands. To do my own work, mind my won business, and have no time for slanderers.
