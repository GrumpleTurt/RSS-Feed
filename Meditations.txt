1.1 My Grandfather Verus
Character and self-control.

1.2 My Father (From My Own Memories and His Reputation)
Integrity and manliness.

1.3 My Mother
Her reverence for the divine, her generosity, her inability not only to do wrong but even to conceive of doing it. And the simple way 
she lived-not in the least like the rich

1.4  My Great-Grandfather
To avoid the public schools, to hire good private teachers, and to accept the resulting costs as money well-spent.

1.5 My First Teacher
Not to support this side or that in chariot-racing, this fighter or that in the games. To put up with discomfort and not make demands. To do my own work, mind my won business, and have no time for slanderers.

1.6 Diognetus
Not to waste time on nonsense. Not to be taken in by conjurors and hoodoo artists with their talk about incantations and exorcism and all the rest of it. Not to be obsessed with quail-fighting or other crazes like that. To hear unwelcome truths. To practice, philosophy, and to study with Baccheius, and then with Tandasis and Marcianus. To write dialogues as a student. To choose the Greek lifestyle-the camp-bed and the cloak.

1.7 Rusticus
The recognition that I needed to train and discipline my character. Not to be sidetracked by my interest in rhetoric. Not to write treatises on abstract questions, or deliver moralizing little sermons, or compose imaginary descriptions of The Simple Life or The Man Who Lives Inly for Others. To steer of oratory, poetry and belles lettres.
Not to dress up just to stroll around the house, or things like that. To write straightforward letters (like the one he sent my mother from Sinuessa). And to behave in a conciliatory way when people who have angered or annoyed us want to make up. 
To read attentively-not to be satisfied with "just getting the gist of it." And not to fall for every smooth talker.
And for introducing me to Epictetus's lectures-and loaning me his own copy.
